# Bus Tracking Exercise

This is an exercise I completed as an assignment for the MIT- xPro Professional Certificate in Coding: Women's Cohert. 
This project shows the location of the bus stops between MIT and Harvard on a map. 
The map is accessed through Mapbox. 

To run this project, download the files included and save them all in the same path on your machine. Run the html in your browser.

Next in this repository, I would like to add points on a map show a route from NJ to CA, that shows all of the stops to make between. This will include moving location markers as well as the zoom and focus on the map moving.
